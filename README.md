## Hi there 👋 I'm Ife Adeyosoye

I'm a Computer Science major at Northeastern University focused on exploring how code can shape the physical world, particularly through robotics and AI. With a concentration in AI and an intended minor in Computer Engineering, I am passionate about hands-on, challenging experiences that combine software, hardware, and a great deal of creativity. 

Curiosity and teaching myself new skills have developed me into a fast learner, technology-wise. I have experience using **Python/Java** in AI and robotics applications, as well as hands-on experience with hardware. Furthermore, with a strong foundation in math, I enjoy finding ways to apply it meaningfully in my studies.
